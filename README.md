# js-module-walker

A dependency analyser for js projects using es6 modules.

# Usage

This is still work in progress, for now you have to clone this repository and first
install all dependencies and install into your global node modules:

```
$ npm install
# npm install -g .
```

Then you can analyze your project with

```
$ js-module-walker <path/to/your/project/root> > graph.dot
```
