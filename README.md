# js-module-walker

A dependency analyser for js projects using es6 modules.

# Usage

This is still work in progress, for now you have to clone this repository and first
install all dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Then you can analyze your project with

```
$ npm start <path/to/your/project/root> -s > graph.dot
```
